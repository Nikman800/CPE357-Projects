Assignment 2 Decomposition Outline Document

Program Requirements: The program will need to take user input and print out questions. It will need to read and write to a file and the file will need a structure so that the program can interpret that it is a decision tree. The program hence should also be able to add questions to the decision tree. 

Datastructure definitions: Since we have to create a decision tree, we could possibly use a binary tree to accomplish this. The program, once run, will create the tree from reading info from the qa.db file.

Function prototypes: A function can be made for creating the decision tree, or one for updating the file. 

Pseudocode for main:

count = 0 
if qa.db does not exist:    
	print: No such file or directory
	print: Unable to read database qa.db. Starting fresh.
	file create qa.db
	print: What is it (With article)?
	read = get string from user
	file add count*("-") + read
	
else:
	create tree
	while
		print: "is it" + str(tree1)
		read = get string from user 
		if read = yes
			tree1 = tree1.left
		else
			tree1 = tree1.right
		count++
		if tree1 is question
			pass
		else if tree1 is answer
			print: "My, am I clever. :) Thanks for playing."
			exit
		else
			print: "How disappointing"
			go to update file class (will prob use count which is used to determine tier of question)
			exit
	

    
   
Test strategy and corner cases defined: Will test with varying string lengths and with different orientations of trees.
